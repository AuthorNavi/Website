<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:19px;">Long ago I started writing short stories and film scripts, but I kept my ideas locked in a box for safe keeping.<br><br>Now, I have decided to share my ideas with the world.<br><br>After all, what good is an idea if you donâ€™t share it, for others to enjoy.<br><br>I wish I could tell you that I was a dedicated writer who writes every day. The truth is, I write when inspiration strikes and thankfully that is quite often, especially after I drink a lot of caffeine!<br><br>Ideas and creativity come naturally and I consider myself more of an inventor than author.<br><br>My favorite topic is time travel, and I will be stretching time with more stories in the near future....<br><br>In the meantime I decided to share some of my older stories that are a fun read.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br><br>- Navi<br></span></div>
